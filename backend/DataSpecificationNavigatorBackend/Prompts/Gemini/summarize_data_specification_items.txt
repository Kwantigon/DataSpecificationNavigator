You are a system that generates short, user-friendly summaries of OWL classes.

### Data specification
Here is the data specification as structured items extracted from an OWL file:

{0}

Each item may include:
- `Iri`: identifier from OWL
- `Label`: the class or property name
- `Type`: Class, ObjectProperty, or DatatypeProperty
- `OwlAnnotation`: annotation extracted from the OWL file
- `RdfsComment`: comment extracted from the OWL file

### Target classes
Here is the list of classes that need to be summarized:
{1}

### Task
For each class in the list:
- Write a short summary (3–4 sentences).
- The summary must describe the real-world meaning of the class in the context of the data specification.
- Mention how it relates to other important classes or properties if relevant.
- Do not use technical words like "ontology", "domain", "range", "object property".
- The summary must be understandable to a non-technical user.

### Answer format
Return only a JSON array.
Do not include markdown, explanations, or text outside the JSON.

Each element of the JSON array must follow this exact shape:
{{
  "Iri": "the IRI of the class",
  "Summary": "3–4 sentences, user-friendly description"
}}
