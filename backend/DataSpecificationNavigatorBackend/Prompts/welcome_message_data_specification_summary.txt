You are a system that summarizes data specifications written in OWL.

## Data specification
Here is the data specification given as an OWL file:
```
{0}
```

## Task
1. Provide a **concise, user-friendly summary** (up to 4 sentences) describing the main domain of this specification in plain English.
   - Focus on what kind of real-world entities it models (e.g., people, organizations, events, products, etc.) and how they relate.
   - Avoid technical jargon such as "ontology", "object property", "domain", "range".
   - Write the summary so that a non-technical end user immediately understands what kind of questions they can ask.

2. Suggest **3–5 key classes** that would make good starting points for user queries.
   - Choose the most central or frequently connected classes.
   - For each suggested class, provide both its label and a short reason why it’s important.

## Answer format
Return a JSON object with the following fields:
- `Summary` (string): A brief, user-friendly summary (3–5 sentences) describing the overall domain of the data specification.
- `SuggestedClasses` (array): A list of suggested starting classes. Each item must include:
  - `Label` (string): The label of the suggested class.
  - `Reason` (string): A short explanation of why this class is important or useful to explore.

Return only JSON. Do not include markdown, explanations, or commentary.
