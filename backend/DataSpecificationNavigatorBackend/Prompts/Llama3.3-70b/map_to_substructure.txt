You are a system that maps words from natural language questions to items in a structured data specification.

### User question
The question that user asked is:
"{0}"

### Current context
The following items have been identified as having been directly mentioned in the question:

{1}

### Task
Map each item in the current context to the exact words or phrases in the user question that refer to it.
- Every item from the current context must be mapped.
- Do not assign the same phrase to multiple items.
- MappedWords must not be empty.

### Output format
Return only a raw JSON array where each element has this structure:
[
  {{
    "Iri": "string",
    "MappedWords": "string"
  }}
]

IMPORTANT:
- Do not include markdown, explanations, or commentary.  
- If the question is incoherent or unrelated, return [].
