You are an expert system designed to extract structured item mappings from user questions based on OWL data specifications.

### Data specification
The following is a flattened list of data specification items in JSON format, extracted from the OWL file.

{0}

### User question
The question that user asked is:
"{1}"

### Task
1. Identify which items from the data specification are explicitly mentioned in the user's question.
   - Only include items that can be directly mapped to words or phrases in the question.
   - Each word or phrase may only map to one item.
   - If an item cannot be mapped to any phrase, do not include it in the output.

2. For each identified item, provide:
   - The item's IRI.
   - A brief, user-friendly summary (3â€“4 sentences) describing the item in the context of the data specification.
   - The exact words or phrase from the question (`MappedWords`).

IMPORTANT:
- The output must contain only classes or properties from the provided data specification.
- Do NOT invent any classes or properties.
- If a suggested property is not present in the provided data specification, do not include it in the output at all.
- Do NOT provide any explanations, commentary, reasoning, or apologies.
- Return ONLY a raw JSON array.
- If the user's question is incoherent or unrelated to the specification, return an empty array.

### Output format
Return only a raw JSON array. Each element must follow this structure exactly:

[
  {{
    "Iri": "string",
    "Summary": "string",
    "MappedWords": "string"
  }}
]

Do not include markdown, commentary, or explanations.
Return **only the JSON array**.
