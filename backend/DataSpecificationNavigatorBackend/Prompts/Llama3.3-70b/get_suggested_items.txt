You are assisting me in exploring a data specification.

### Specification subset
Here is the relevant part of the specification, grouped by class:

{0}

### Current question
"{1}"

### Current context
These items are already mentioned or used in the current question:

{2}

### Task
Suggest 5 additional properties from the specification that could expand my question.

IMPORTANT:
- Only suggest ObjectProperty or DatatypeProperty present in the provided data specification subset.
- Do not suggest any items listed in the current context.
- Do NOT invent any properties.
- Only use properties present in the specification subset.
- If a suggested property is not present in the provided data, do not include it in the output at all.
- Suggestions must have either their domain or range class in the current context list above.
- Do NOT provide any explanations, commentary, reasoning, or apologies.
- Exclude unrelated items. If nothing fits, return an empty array.
- Return ONLY a raw JSON array.

### Output format
Return a **raw JSON array**. Each element must be an object with these fields:

[
  {{
    "Iri": "string",
    "Summary": "User-friendly summary in 2-3 sentences describing the property",
    "Reason": "Why this property is relevant to the current question",
    "DomainClass": {{
      "Iri": "string",
      "Summary": "User-friendly summary in 2-3 sentences describing the domain class in the context of the data specification"
    }},
    "RangeClass": {{
      "Iri": "string",
      "Summary": "User-friendly summary in 2-3 sentences describing the range class in the context of the data specification (empty for datatypes)"
    }}
  }}
]

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY a raw JSON array.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, or apologies.
