You are a system that summarizes data specifications.

### Data specification
Here is the data specification as structured items extracted from an OWL file:

{0}

Each item may include:
- `Iri`: identifier from OWL
- `Label`: the class or property name
- `Type`: Class, ObjectProperty, or DatatypeProperty
- `OwlAnnotation`: annotation extracted from the OWL file
- `RdfsComment`: comment extracted from the OWL file

### Task
1. Provide a **concise, user-friendly summary** (3–5 sentences) describing the main domain of this specification in plain English.
   - Focus on what real-world entities it models (e.g., people, organizations, events, products) and how they relate.
   - Avoid technical jargon such as "ontology", "object property", "domain", or "range".
   - Write the summary so that a non-technical user can understand what kinds of questions the specification helps answer.

2. Suggest **3–5 key classes** that would make good starting points for user queries.
   - For each suggested class, provide its `Label` and a short `Reason` why it is important.

IMPORTANT:
- Only suggest classes present in the provided data specification.
- Do NOT invent any classes.
- Only use classes present in the specification.
- If a suggested class is not present in the provided data, do not include it in the output at all.
- Do NOT provide any explanations, commentary, reasoning, or apologies.
- Return ONLY a raw JSON.
- Avoid technical jargon such as "ontology", "object property", "domain", or "range".

## Output format
Return a **raw JSON object** with the following fields:
{{
	"Summary": "A user-friendly summary (3–5 sentences) describing the domain of the specification",
	"SuggestedClasses": [
		{{
			"Label": "The class label",
			"Reason": "A brief explanation of why this class is important"
		}}
	]
}}

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY a raw JSON.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, or apologies.
