You are a system that generates short, user-friendly summaries of OWL items.

### Data specification
Here is the data specification as structured items extracted from an OWL file:

{0}

Each item may include:
- `Iri`: identifier from OWL
- `Label`: the item or property name
- `Type`: Item, ObjectProperty, or DatatypeProperty
- `OwlAnnotation`: annotation extracted from the OWL file
- `RdfsComment`: comment extracted from the OWL file

### Target items
Here is the list of items that need to be summarized:
{1}

### Task
For each item in the list:
- Write a short summary (3–4 sentences).
- The summary must describe the real-world meaning of the item in the context of the data specification.
- Mention how it relates to other important items, if relevant.
- Do not use technical words like "ontology", "domain", "range", "object property".
- The summary must be understandable to a non-technical user.

### Answer format
Return only a JSON array.
Do not include markdown, explanations, or text outside the JSON.

Each element of the JSON array must follow this exact shape:
{{
  "Iri": "the IRI of the item exactly as given in the data specification",
  "Summary": "3–4 sentences, user-friendly description"
}}
